// In a multi-file project, we create 1 file for each class that we define, plus 1 file to 
// be the application's "entry point". The name of the entrypoint is unimportant, but we often
// choose "Program".

// In a single-file program, certain libraries are automatically included for us. But now we are 
// doing everything manually. The System library includes classes for I/O, random numbers, math, and more.

// Every class should belong in a namespace, which differentiates the class from others that might have
// the same name. (How many classes named "Program" might exist in the world?)

	// Classes begin with an access modifier, specifying which other classes in .NET should be able to use
	// this class. Since this class is just the entry point of the application, and not something reusable by others,
	// we mark it "internal": it can only be used by code in this Project, and nowhere else.

		internal static void Main(string[] args) {
			// internal: this method can only be called by this project, and not from outside the project.
			// static: this method does not operate on an object of the "Program" class (there won't be any).
			// void: the return type; this method does not return anything.
			// Main: the name of the method; it must be Main to be the project's entry point.
			// string[] args: the parameter to the method, an array of strings passed in from the command line.
